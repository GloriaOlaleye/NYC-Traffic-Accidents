# NYC-Traffic-Accidents

## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed Motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department from January 2021 to April 2023. Each record represents an individual collision, including the date, time, and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.

Recommended Analysis
Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?

Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?

On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?

What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported? What about for fatal accidents specifically?
